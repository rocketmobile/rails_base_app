  # Errors

  Conventional [HTTP status codes](http://httpstatus.es/) are used to indicate success or failure of an API request.
  In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a parameter was missing or didn't pass validation, a rescource didn't exist for the id requested, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error on the server-side.

  In addition to the HTTP status code, an `errors` key is provided in the case of a failure response. The value is an array of error objects that will give specific information about the error.

  In most cases, there will only be a single error object in the `errors` array. However in specific cases, such as the creation of a resource with multiple validated fields, multiple errors may be returned, corresponding to the multiple failed validations (e.g. a user submits a blank account creation form).

  ### The error object

  #### Attributes

  #{attr_title('parameter', type: :string)}

  The parameter the error relates to if the error is parameter-specific. You can use this to display a message near the correct form field, for example.

  #{attr_title('message', type: :string)}

  A localized, human-readable message giving more details about the error. These messages can be shown to your users. These messages may change at any time, so their values shouldn't be used in client-side logic.
